## Overview

Credit Card Approval Prediction is a machine learning system that predicts the approval status of credit card applications using applicant demographic and financial information.  
The project automates decision-making for banks or financial institutions, delivering efficient, scalable, and interpretable risk assessment through data-driven models.

Core goals:
- Seamlessly preprocess and analyze applicant data.
- Compare and validate multiple ML algorithms for approval accuracy.
- Empower business or technical users with clear results, visualizations, and customizable workflows.

## Features

- **Automated Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical fields, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visual summaries and statistics for all features.
- **Model Training & Comparison** – Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble methods.
- **Evaluation Dashboard** – Outputs accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and more.
- **Parameter Tuning & Error Analysis** – K value optimization (KNN), kernel selection (SVM), and mis-classification inspection.
- **Modular, Readable Notebook Design** – Structured for clarity, experimentation, and quick customization.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** & **numpy** – Data manipulation, SQL-like query support
- **scikit-learn** – ML models and evaluation
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – Visualization and plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive, stepwise development
- **pandasql** – SQL queries on DataFrames

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/creditcard-approval-prediction.git
    cd creditcard-approval-prediction
    ```
2. Install requirements:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Place your dataset (`creditcard_data.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `Creditcard-approval-prediction-project.ipynb`.
4. Run each cell in order to:
    - Clean and explore data
    - Train and validate models
    - Analyze & compare results
5. View results in output cells, tables, and `results/metrics_tables.csv`.
6. Plots and figures will appear in the `assets/figures/` folder.

---

## Examples

- Input:  
    Data fields include attributes such as gender, age, marital status, income, asset values, employment details, and more.
- Output:  
    Approval prediction (`Approved` or `Denied`) for each applicant, plus detailed model performance metrics.

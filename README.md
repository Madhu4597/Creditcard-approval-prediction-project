## Overview  
Credit Card Approval Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the approval status of credit card applications based on applicant demographic and financial data.  
The system streamlines decision-making for banks and financial institutions by providing scalable, interpretable risk assessments through data-driven models developed and tested in both VSCode and Jupyter Notebook environments.  
This project features a Streamlit-powered user interface for easy interaction and visualization of prediction results.

Core goals:  
- Efficient data preprocessing, including cleaning and encoding.  
- Comparative evaluation of multiple ML algorithms for predictive accuracy.  
- User-friendly deployment through Streamlit, enabling interactive input and real-time predictions.

## Features  
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, categorical encoding, and normalization steps.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical summaries of features.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble models.  
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix visualizations.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning & Error Analysis**: Optimization of K in KNN, kernel selection for SVM, and detailed misclassification review.  
- **Deployment with Streamlit**: Interactive web interface for inputting applicant data and displaying model predictions dynamically.  
- **Modular Notebook & Script Design**: Clear structure in Jupyter Notebook and VSCode for easy experimentation and modifications.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/creditcard-approval-prediction.git  
    cd creditcard-approval-prediction  
    ```  
2. Install required dependencies:  
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```  

---  
## Usage  
1. Place the dataset file (e.g., `creditcard_data.csv`) inside the `data/` directory.  
2. To explore and train models, launch Jupyter Notebook:  
    ```
    jupyter notebook  
    ```  
3. Open the notebook file: `Creditcard-approval-prediction-project.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and analyze results.  
4. Alternatively, run Python scripts in VSCode for code-based experimentation and automation.  
5. Findings and evaluation reports will be saved in the `results/` and visualization assets in the `assets/figures/` folders.  

---  
## Deployment  
1. To launch the interactive Streamlit application, run:  
    ```
    streamlit run app.py  
    ```  
2. Use the provided UI to input applicant details and obtain real-time credit approval predictions based on the trained models.

## Live Demo  
Try the interactive web app for Credit Card Approval Prediction here:  
[Credit Card Approval Prediction Streamlit App](https://creditcard-approval-prediction-project-qhoknt8ij37fzfsappreklw.streamlit.app/)  

---  
## Examples  
- **Input**: Applicant details such as age, income, employment information, credit history, and other financial attributes.  
- **Output**: Credit approval status (`Approved` / `Denied`) along with model confidence scores and performance visualizations.
